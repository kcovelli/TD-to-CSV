# TD-to-CSV
TD credit card statement PDF to CSV

TD doesn't let you export credit card info as a csv for some reason, only as PDFs, and only one PDF for each month at that.
This is just a simple program to use OCR to convert the PDFs to CSVs.

Also has a sort of command line interface to iterate through the converted transactions for review, assign a description for each one.

Note that this was just a small project I made for personal use and is not documented very well if at all.
